Becoming-Data_engineer
This repository documents my journey to become a Machine Learning Engineer. It contains the list of projects undertaken, books read, courses pursued and almost everything I did in the process. So follow along or diverge to you own path, either way, I believe this will add value to any data professional / enthusiast.
